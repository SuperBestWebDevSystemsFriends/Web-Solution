# SBWDSF COMP2030 WEB SOLUTION REPO

For this assignment you will apply your learning, implement your design, and utilise a range of tools to build an ecommerce front end web site.

## Requirements: 

    As a group discuss your individual designs from Report - UX Design. 
    Develop an agreed design for the SENIOR ecommerce website and divide the work fairly between group members. 
    Create a web site map and code design for an online shopping site for your product. Outline the HTML, any style components, and scripting (JS and PHP) you will use and justify the use of each. 
    Provide pages to allow a shopper to view product images, brief descriptions, and prices. 
    Provide pages to allow a shopper to select products to buy and then view all products selected in a shopping cart. The cart should provide a total cost for the selected products. 
    Provide a page for a shopper to enter their payment details and complete the transaction. (NOTE that ‘completing the transaction’ simply means storing the products and payment details in a database.) Confidential data such as credit card numbers must be stored securely. How this is done will be a group decision. 
    As a group consider the requirements for the community marketplace functionality and implement that functionality. You will also need to document the function and the way in which you implemented it.

## Requirement detail and constraints: 

    You are to develop an AMPP stack enabled e-commerce website with a backend database 
    Add at least 10 products to your database 
    Develop a style sheet using CSS to ensure consistent formatting of all pages 
    Develop your own method for recording all purchases, validating all transaction details, and securing confidential data. 
    The server-side scripting component must be implemented in PHP 
    No web frameworks (e.g. Angular, Laravel, Bootstrap, etc) may be used

## Submission:

Part 1: You need to submit your source code for the website, as a single zip file. The zip file must include an SQL script to recreate your database. The code will be referred to in order to assess the functionality. You will be asked to demonstrate your solution to the teaching team at a designated time. 

Part 2: Your report should discuss your website design and code decisions and include screenshots for each page as an appendix. You should include your database ER diagram, site map, and outline and justify the HTML, JS, and PHP you used to implement the functionality. Discuss the creative inclusions your group added to the base specification and explain and justify your transaction validation and security functionality. 

Your development report should not exceed 10 pages of content including any required references but excluding appendices, table of contents, and the cover page. 

Your document should apply good academic integrity. All product images that are not your own MUST be referenced. Text should be 11point Arial and justified. Headings should be numbered. Figures and examples should be within the body of the text, numbered and referenced. References should appear in text and at the end of the document and consistently use any standard referencing style. 

## Marking Guidelines: 

### Your website implementation (100 marks) will be graded based on how well it: 

    Implements the 3 stipulated behaviours (product display, shopping cart, and payment completion), as well as any other necessary functionality for an e-commerce website 
    Implements the additional marketplace functionality 
    Follows basic principles of usability, tidy visual presentation, etc. 
    Is robust to unexpected input 
    Demonstrates good software design

### Your report submission (50 marks) will be graded based on how well it: 

    Presents a working web site including all required functionality as outlined in the specification and within the detailed constraints. (15 marks) 
    Justifies and presents appropriate validation and security methods. (10 marks) 
    Shows creativity and good development of the marketplace functionality (10 marks) 
    Outlines and justifies appropriate design and code constructs to implement all functionality (10 marks) 
    Is formatted and structured, including a consistent reference style and good language. (5 marks) 

Website Implementation and Report will be worth 30% of the total topic mark.
